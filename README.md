# Portfolio Site (scaffold)

This is a minimal, polished portfolio scaffold you can customize quickly.

Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit `index.html` to change your name and bio.
3. Update `script.js` → `projects` array with your projects and links.
4. Replace `resume.pdf` with your resume file.

Deployment

- For GitHub Pages: push this folder to a repo and enable Pages for the `main` branch.
- For Netlify/Vercel: drag & drop or connect the repo and deploy.

Need help customizing? Paste your resume, project links, and color preferences and I’ll integrate them.
